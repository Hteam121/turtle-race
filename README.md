# turtle-race

This project is from Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023"

This is a simple project where a user can input a bet for the color turtle they want to win. And using 
random values, it will move each colored turtle a random space until it reaches the end, where it will display the winner.
